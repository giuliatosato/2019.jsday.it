    title: Dear JavaScript
    extract: >
      This is the story of Cirpo's journey with JavaScript. It’s about the things that he wishes he knew since the
      beginning, his “ah-ah that’s how it works! moments that guided him to coding in a more expressive and declarative
      way. It's a love letter for this powerful language, a talk that bounces between the technical and the personal
      perspectives. Cirpo's hope is that everyone in the room, even experienced developers, will learn a bit more about
      writing more idiomatic and consistent JS code, learning from the mistakes he made and that he still witness every
      time he sees other devs start using it.

    title: The journey through the hybrid mobile apps with JS
    extract: >
      Four years ago I started a wonderful adventure: I tried to build my first mobile application with JavaScript. The
      first encounter was ugly and I kind of accepted the fact that hybrid mobile applications are cheap, slow and
      limited brothers of native ones (I was mistaken!). However, due to financial efficiency, I was bumping into it
      again and again. I tried all popular JavaScript solution for Hybrid Mobile apps and ended my journey through the
      hybrid mobile applications with a happy end. I want to share with you the recipes we've learned, tell my story
      and warn regarding the possible pitfalls. We'll look into the React Native, Cordova, PWA's and compare them with
      native applications looking into the experience we've got working with them on real projects.

    title: Building Automation in the browser - An experience report
    extract: >
      Having a bunch of IoT-ready and remotely controllable devices only makes sense if the controls are intuitive and
      the control surface is easily accessible. In the beginning of 2018, we started implementing such a user interface
      for our office building using only JavaScript with frameworks like BabylonJS and React. This interface displays
      the real-time state of our numerous devices, offers control panels for managing them and also incorporates other
      services, like AWS and a calendar-API. We now want to show you how our microservice-application fits into the the
      IoT-landscape and the overall architecture of our office building automation infrastructure and want to talk about
      the pitfalls we encountered and the lessons we learned. There is no prior knowledge required about BabylonJS,
      building automation or even JavaScript - the talk focuses on our experiences, our lessons learned and our
      architecture on a higher level, and does not go into technical details.

    title: "Mixed Reality: Zero to Hero in 25 min"
    extract: >
      This talk will be a quick run-through of the Mixed Reality (MR) concepts, i.e both Virtual Reality (VR) and
      Augmented Reality (AR), but specifically from a web developer’s perspective. Even though MR is graphics-heavy,
      modern libraries like WebVR, AFrame VR and Web XR make it really easy for a web developer working with HTML and
      JavaScript, to follow through and use existing tools to start building useful Mixed Reality applications that can
      be accessed on the web. We’ll close the talk with a demo and behind-the-scenes of how it’s built. Bonus: Tools and
      resources to use in your MR apps.

    title: Reinventing RxJS
    extract: >
      RxJS has become almost a standard in the emerging reactive Front-End world. If you're not using it right now, you
      probably played with a few operators. In the talk we're going to rewrite RxJS from scratch, seeing behind the
      curtains which are the core components and the ideas of the library. You'll see how to build Observables,
      Subscriptions and Operator, then we'll introduce Schedulers and how they're used in RxJS. If you fancy Reactive
      Programming or simply you want to learn something new then... this talk is for you!

    title: Rapid Cross-Platform AR Development with React Native
    extract: >
      Augmented Reality's popularity is growing at an ever increasing rate, and it might seem as if native iOS and
      Android developers are the only ones who have the skills to keep up. Fortunately, a platform called Viro was
      created to enable web and mobile developers to develop cross-platform AR/VR experiences through the React Native
      framework. We'll take a brief look at what AR is and how it works, and then take a deep dive into Viro and
      everything it provides to get you moving rapidly with AR development. We'll focus on a few very interesting pieces
      that Viro provides, such as 3D models, portals, image recognition, and real life object recognition. By the end of
      this session, you will have the skills and inspiration to start working with AR immediately!

      While about 51% of the world’s websites are in English, only about 25% of web users are English speakers. With
      half of the world’s population online, internationalisation is as relevant as ever! Let’s explore how i18n gets
      made on the web and what we should keep in mind or avoid when making the web more accessible to the world.

    title: "Evolutionary UI: Change as a first-class citizen in the modern frontend world"
    extract: >
      Allowing for change is especially important when designing your frontend applications, where high user
      expectations meet the fast-paced JavaScript ecosystem. For example, have you ever tried migrating from Angular to
      React while hitting your deliverables and without compromising performance? Change is intimidating. In this talk,
      we will show how the principles of evolutionary architecture* can be applied to UI to prioritize changeability.
      We’ll consider several approaches to making a modern UI application more evolvable, such as the micro-frontends
      pattern, and examine specific “fitness functions” that will keep you and your team honest to your evolvability
      goals. We’ll also discuss the tradeoffs you make when you choose a more evolutionary frontend architecture, and
      provide a framework for thinking about how much future change you’ll need to account
      for. *evolutionaryarchitecture.com

    title: Beats, Rhymes and Unit Tests
    extract: >
      Speech recognition is all around us. From the smartphones in our pockets to the devices at the heart of our
      digital homes, we’re never far from speech recognition technology. Not only does it enable new ways of interacting
      with computers, it’s also set to reshape Human Computer Interaction for people requiring assistive technologies.
      The humble web browser is no exception. The speechRecognitionAPI enables developers to incorporate advanced speech
      interactions into today’s web applications. But is it any good? Combining two of his passions, Tony sets out to
      discover if the speechRecognitionAPI can be used as an aid in transcribing hip-hop lyrics during the writing
      process.
      After an introduction to the broader technology, a mix of audio, video and live performance tells the tale of
      creating an MVP transcription application to aid in the writing of new songs. As a development project, each
      iteration of the app is accompanied by a set of unit tests. The final unit test is executed live, resulting in
      a crescendo you won’t want to miss.

    extract: >
      React Hooks are going to change the way we write React components and apps. Let's explore together a real world
      refactoring of an app with hooks, introducing the concept and exploring how the mental model of components has to
      evolve breaking the dichotomy of stateful class vs stateless "functional" components. We are going to deep dive in
      the code of the app, a quite busy stateful component, looking at how we could use hooks to refactor it.

    title: "WebAssembly: Browser is now a real virtual machine"
    extract: >
      WebAssembly is a new virtual machine embedded in the browser. It doesn't transpile to JavaScript like its
      forerunners; it produces a new binary format, like the old assembler, executed in a dedicated VM into your
      browser. Genius, it exposes a bridge between JS APIs and WebAssembly executables. Last browsers engines
      developments allow very fast exchanges between JS and WASM code. So, let's start with a projet that need a
      huge computing time. We will develop the core code in Rust, compile it to WASM using LLVM, and we will display
      the results in a front view powered via JavaScript. No need to know how does it work, we will see it together.
      This talk takes place in a new series named #StartFromNowhere: let's start from front-end developers skills, and
      deep dive into a new technology. In 45', let's learn the basics.

    title: "Fearless Refactoring in Elm"
    extract: >
      When we take on a big refactoring, we often get this uncomfortable feeling of doubt. A little demon appears on our
      shoulder and asks "Did you remember to make all the changes? Are you sure? Sure sure?". We check the code again,
      run the tests and all is passing. Great. But that demon is still there, still nagging "Are you super sure? The
      tests were passing last time too...". In this talk, we will see how Elm can free us from those moments of self
      doubt. We will start with a short introduction of the language, explaining its design and philosophy. We will then
      start a full-on refactoring in the biggest Elm codebase in the world. We will see how the Elm compiler can help us
      make this sort of changes in a confident and predictable way. At the end of the talk, you will have a good
      understanding of how Elm works and what advantages it can bring to your toolset.
